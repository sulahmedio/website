									<h3>So yes… It IS okay to change career paths later in life. </h3>
                                        
                                    <p>I am a huge believer in the idea that it's okay to change career paths later in life. In fact, I think it's almost necessary. The problem is that many people don't know how to start thinking about changing careers because they’re scared of the unknown, which is understandable. </p>

                                    <p>It's important to think about what you want and what you don't want out of your career (and life) before making any decisions. If you're unsure whether or not you should change careers, ask yourself these questions: what am I doing right now, that I don’t like? What skillsets do I have? How can this transition be easy, ALL things considered? In my eight years of experience in the industry, I’ve realized that a lot of the time, a job that does not fulfill us emotionally or academically, but when it does, the feeling doesn’t last too long. We often end up asking ourselves if there is anything else out there for us. I can say that I am definitely guilty of this. </p>
                                        
                                    <p>I think actually this is the reason that some of us start looking into “side hustles” or something that will be able to stimulate us in another way. But even then, we can come across some obstacles, like lacking the skillset to get something produced, so then we get side-tracked by deep-diving into that, till we realize “oops… What the hell just happened??”  I find that often times when I don’t know what/how to do something, I will hit up some friends of mine and ask them what their day-to-day looks like and if that would be something that interests me. </p>
                                        
                                    <p>Now we’ve got a few things to think about: </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> What don’t I like? And why? </li>
                                        <li>What skillsets do I have that can be applied to another role?</li>
                                        <li>Considering everything, how can I make an easy transition?</li>
                                        <li>How much am I willing to learn?</li>
                                        <li>How much of a pay cut am I willing to take?</li>
                                        <li>What kind of a network do I have that I can leverage?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>With all that bring thought about, now we can start making a plan to move ahead. Here's my biggest goal-related, unsolicited advice for you... WRITE. IT. DOWN! Now I don't mean typing things up on Microsoft Word, no I mean take a pen and a pad, and put ink to paper. Wrtiing things down creates a subconscious mental connection for you, and you start to think about ways to implement ideas, and thoughts, like never before.</p>

                                    <p>Write out what you don't like, all the skillsets that you have, and potential roles that you would like to do. Then look at your friends, acquaintences, family members, and strangers and just ask meaningful questions. This will open your mind up to more roles that could be a fit for you, but also put you on their radar of helping you, or even potentially bringing you onboard with them... Possbilites are endless when you just talk to people in a meaninful way.</p>

                                    <p>After you've completed that first task of writing things out, do it again, and this time truly gauge what you are trying to accomplish with this upcoming change... What you thought it wouldn't require work? Lol, come on friend... it takes time, effort and quite a bit of brain power to do these things, for most of us! Anyways, once you've used the power of your brain, now you're going to have some clarity with what is required of you to actually get things rolling. The path is clearing up.</p>

                                    <p>Time to make a plan! Do you need to take courses? Do you want to shadow folks that are in that role? Is there even a role for what you are looking to do? Should you volunteer in that role? Again... Write this plan down! Step-by-step, you continue to gain clarity on what your next move should look like. Then you write down your goals. See what I did there? With the clarity?... No? ok.... anyyyways!</p>

                                    <p>Now it's time to take action! As I said, this will take time and effort to just begin, with a plan, goals, and action, everything is possible. People often get too caught up in the research part of things and setting up plans, that we forget to actually execute on the plan. Make sure you don't fall into that pit! You can always step back, take a break and resume where you left off. Once you start taking action, it will take time for things to fall into place. TRUST. THE. PROCESS. Don't get impatient and just quit after a short-while. You got this!</p>

                                    <p>In conclusion, if you're thinking about changing careers, the few things I would say to keep in mind are:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Have meaningful conversations</li>
                                        <li>Write things down - like your goals, and plan</li>
                                        <li>Trust the process</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Now go get'em tiger! I believe in you!</p>

                                    <p>Always with love,</p>
                                    <p>Sully</p>
